NetworkSceneGraph
=================

NetworkSceneGraph is an Objective-C framework that describes an API for a new internet browsing standard - distributed 3D scenes. The API that the NetworkSceneGraph API uses is powered by HTTP and JSON, making it cross-platform. On OS X this framework can render the distributed scene using SceneKit.
